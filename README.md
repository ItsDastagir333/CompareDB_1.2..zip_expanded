**CompareDB** is a lightweight **standalone desktop application** that allows users to **compare the schema and data** of two different databases easily and also specifically any two tables of databases also 
The application is packaged as a **runnable JAR** file and comes with a **simple UI** !

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run the Application:**
   - Double-click the `CompareDB.jar` file  
   *(or run it using the command `java -jar CompareDB.jar` if needed)*.

2. **Fill in the Database Details:**
   - The **UI will pop up** asking for:
     - Database A Connection Details (URL, Username, Password, Type)
     - Database B Connection Details (URL, Username, Password, Type)
     - If want to have comparison between any two Specific tables, then click on Toggle button with title "Compare Mode". Fields for inserting table names for both the databases will appear, put in your table name 

3. **Submit:**
   - Click the **"Submit"** button.
   - The application will save your input internally and begin the **comparison process**.

4. **Completion:**
   - Once the comparison is done, you will see a **Success Alert** saying **"Database Comparison Completed"**.

5. **Output:**

   - This file contains the **comparison results** (schema and data differences, if any).

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- Make sure your database server allows connections from your IP address.
- Ensure database ports (like **3306** for MySQL or **1433** for MSSQL) are open.
- If using cloud databases, whitelist your IP and use the full JDBC URL provided by your cloud provider.
